          <h2>Project Description</h2>
          <p>Our team worked with <a href="https://ugandanwaterproject.com">the Ugandan Water Project</a> to design a durable and cheap device that could
            be attached to hand pumps in Uganda to limit the amount of sediment that entered the pump. The goal of our device was to reduce the amount of abrasive
            sediment in the pump. This would extended the lifetime of the gaskets inside the pump and save maintence costs. We were able to build a testing
            set up and prototype some initial designs, but due to the COVID-19 pandemic we were not able to continue. Instead we compiled all of the research and
            preliminary findings we had into technical transfer document. </p>

          <h2>Testing Set-up</h2>
          <p>Our team designed a smaller scale version of the pumping set up in the undergraduate chemical engineering lab. <a href="https://ugandanwaterproject.com">The Ugandan Water Project</a>
            provided us with an upper pump assembly and an India Mark II handpump. We connected a pipe with a threaded rod inside of it from the upper pump assembly
            to the India Mark II pump. The India Mark II pump was placed in a large drum of water and the outlet of the upper pump assembly was recycled into this drum.</p>

          <h2>Computational Fluid Dynamics</h2>
          <p>I specialized in the computational fluid dynamics analysis of prototypes on our team. I self-taught the Ansys fluid dynamics software, Fluent
            and the CAD program SpaceClaim in one month. I was able to get some preliminary results on an initial prototype, but unfortunately due to remote learning I was
            not able to refine my simulations. To the right there is the path of a simulated particle traveling through one of the prototypes.</p>

          <h2>Technical Transfer Documentation</h2>
          <p>In March 2020 University of Rochester switched to online learning due to the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result we had to leave our project for
            another group to continue later. To aid the group that would continue our project we created an extensive technical transfer document outlining
            our research and first steps. We also included additional files that would be useful. From this I learned how to document information on a project
            after it is being put on hold, something that I believe will be useful later in my career.</p>
